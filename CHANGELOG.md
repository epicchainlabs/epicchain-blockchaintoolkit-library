# EpicChainBlockchain Toolkit Change Log

This document serves as a comprehensive record for all significant updates and modifications made to the EpicChainBlockchain Toolkit project. Each modification, enhancement, or fix is meticulously documented within this file to ensure transparency and ease of tracking for both developers and users alike.

## Format and Versioning Information

The structure of this change log follows the guidelines set forth by the widely recognized [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) methodology. This format has been adopted to provide clarity and consistency in how changes are recorded and presented.

This project operates under [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), which ensures that version numbers convey meaningful information regarding the nature of the updates made. Each release is assigned a version number that reflects whether the changes are major, minor, or related to patch fixes, with the intention of minimizing confusion regarding backward compatibility or the scope of changes introduced.

## Version Management with NerdBank.GitVersioning

The EpicChainBlockchain Toolkit utilizes the powerful [NerdBank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning) tool to automatically manage version numbers in a consistent and reliable manner. Through the integration of this tool, the Semantic Versioning Patch number is dynamically calculated based on the [Git height](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning#what-is-git-height) of the commit that generates each build.

As a result, versions of the project may not follow a sequential order for patch numbers. For example, releases of this package may not exhibit contiguous patch numbers, even though they are incremented based on actual changes to the codebase. This approach helps streamline the versioning process and ensures that each change is accurately reflected without confusion.

### Release Cycle and Documentation

- **Initial Major and Minor Releases:** The first major and minor releases of the EpicChainBlockchain Toolkit will be documented here with no accompanying patch number. These releases will mark significant milestones in the project and will be described in detail to provide insight into the foundational elements of the toolkit.

- **Patch Releases:** Subsequent patch versions will be included to address bug fixes, small improvements, or minor changes that do not affect the overall functionality or stability of the project. It is important to note that the patch version numbers may not always align with the publicly available release versions due to the automated nature of version numbering.

### Change Log Structure

Each entry in this change log will follow a structured format that allows for easy navigation and understanding of the changes. Here is a summary of the format used:

1. **Date of Release:** Each entry will be timestamped to reflect when the change was made available.
2. **Version Number:** A semantic version number indicating the nature of the release (e.g., major, minor, patch).
3. **Description of Changes:** A detailed explanation of the changes, including bug fixes, new features, or any other noteworthy alterations to the project.
4. **Contributors:** The developers or contributors responsible for the changes will be credited for their work.
